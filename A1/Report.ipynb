    "\n",
    "Our team is organized to ensure clear roles and flexible leadership. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Lead Rotation:**  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Team Members and Roles:**  \n",
    "  - **Machine Learning:** Kalle  \n",
    "  - **Front End Development:** Reem  \n",
    "  - **Back End Development:** Rasa, Amol/Reem  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sprint Organization:**  \n",
    "  Sprints will be organized with clear goals, regular check-ins, and task assignments based on individual roles. Based on which domain each one of us is confident with we will plan the sprints and monitor the progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Software and Service Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To streamline collaboration and development, we set up the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slack:**  \n",
    "  Slack will be used as our primary communication channel for updates, discussions, and announcements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git:**  \n",
    "  Git will be used for version control to track code changes, manage branches, and facilitate collaboration between team members. GitHub (or a similar platform) will host the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python:**  \n",
    "  Python is the main programming language for our project. It will be used for backend development, machine learning tasks, and scripting. Besides javascript for the frontend and Node.js packages for the backend\n",
    "- **Hugging Face:**\n",
    "     Hugging face is used to host the model and is synced with the github repository for the project. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook:**  \n",
    "  Jupyter Notebook will be used for documenting experiments, prototyping code, and sharing results. It allows combining code, markdown, and visualizations in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Additional Tools:**  \n",
    "  Depending on specific project needs, additional libraries and frameworks will be installed (e.g., Flask/Django for backend APIs, React for frontend, scikit-learn for ML tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, our team aims for smooth communication, efficient development, and clear documentation throughout the project.\n"
